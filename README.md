# react-firebase-notes-app
## Summary
A simple CRUD application to explore React and Firebase interaction. Implements a simple flexbox layout, and provides the ability for a user to add and remove notes from a Firebase database. I created a video tutorial for building the initial version of this app here: [Link to YouTube video](https://youtu.be/-RtJroTMDf4).
